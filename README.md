# Thesis
 **The goal of this project is to measure the efficiency of Arduino-based small-scale system, which may allow us to see the energy that is gained. Renewable energy sources are clean and safe for the environment and nature. The source of renewable energy is nature. In our context, Arduino can function like human brain while recording, displaying, and controlling the operations. The data from Arduino can be transferred to MATLAB to enable graphical observation. It can show the errors that may occur in the system and can also show which system is more productive in comparison to others.**
## Solar Panel
 **Solar panels collect clean renewable energy in the form of sunlight and convert that light into electricity which can then be used to provide power for electrical loads.**

 ## Steam Turbine
 **I used it as a wind turbine in this project. Wind turbine is a machine that converts kinetic energy from the wind into electricity.**

  ## Peltier Module
 **This module generates electrical energy due to the temperature difference between the two surfaces.**
